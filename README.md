# kijatek

#Project description:
Kijatek.com is a platform where undergraduate/high school/college students can see universities and
high schools (grandes Ã©coles) branches and ranks. School ranks and feedback are given by school
laureates/students. The admin should verify if the user is a school laureate/student. We provide a
filter in the platform to select the schools by ranks, private or public, cities, region and available
branches. In another view of the website, we will use NLP. future student/ user can find a graph
describing sentiments of the laureates that will be done with sentimental analysis on
comments/feedback. Also, there will be toxic comments detector done by deep learning on a Kaggle
dataset. For the first release of the project, there will not be support for French and Darija/Arabic.

#Technologies to use:
